# Rubik's Cube Simulation & Analysis

This project implements a Rubik's Cube simulator and an automated solver using computational group theory principles. It was originally developed as part of a matura thesis and explores how programming can be used to analyze and manipulate cube states.

Mathematics based on [Permutation Puzzles: A Mathematical Perspective](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52591432-permutation-puzzles-a-mathematical-perspective).

## Features

- 3D Cube Simulation: Interactive visualization of a Rubik’s Cube.
- Keyboard Controls: Moves follow Singmaster notation (e.g., U, R, F').
- Automatic Solver: Implements the CFOP solving method.
- State Analysis: Tracks cube permutations and orientations programmatically.


## Usage

- Open cube.html in a browser.
- Use keyboard shortcuts to rotate cube faces.
- Click "Shuffle" for a random scramble.
- Click "Solve" to return to the solved state.

Contributions

Originally developed for my Matura work as a mathematical exploration of the Rubik’s Cube.
